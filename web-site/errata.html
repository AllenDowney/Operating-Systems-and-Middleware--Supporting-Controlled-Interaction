<h1>Errata for Operating Systems and Middleware</h1>

This web page lists errors that have been discovered in the first edition of <a
href="./"><cite>Operating Systems and Middleware:
Supporting Controlled Interaction</cite></a>, by <a
href="../">Max Hailperin</a>. (Please see <a href="./">the main page</a> for information on the revised edition.)
Please report any additional
errors to the author at <a href="mailto:
max@gustavus.edu">max@gustavus.edu</a>.  Other comments are also
welcome.
<p>The errata are listed below in order of page number.

<p>When a line number is negative, it means to count lines up from the
bottom of the page.  Line numbers do not count the header (or footer)
line containing the page number.  Other than that, all
textual lines are counted, even if they are tables,
figure captions, section headings, or textual lines
that contain graphical images.  Any graphical image not contained in a
textual line is not counted, even if the image contains text within
it.

<p>Many thanks to everyone who has reported errors.  Dan Zingaro deserves to be singled out for special recognition.  Thanks!

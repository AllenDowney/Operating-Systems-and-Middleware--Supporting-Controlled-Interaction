<h1>About the Cover</h1>

<p>Sure it is a cool photo, but what is it of? And does it have any
relationship to the topic of the book?</p>

<p>The cover photo shows the <i>siq</i>, or defile, leading to the
ancient Nabatean city of Petra in present-day Jordan.  This is a
narrow, winding passage cut deep into the sandstone primarily by
natural geological forces, though it was improved by the
Nabateans.</p>

<p>Petra was a thriving spice trading city.  Its prosperity can be linked to
several factors, including its location on important trade
routes, its access to water through sophisticated hydraulic
engineering, and its easily defensible character.  The siq played an
important role in the latter two aspects. Water conduits were built
into the walls of the siq.  Meanwhile, the floor of the siq was just
wide enough for a single-file merchant caravan of camels, while
remaining too narrow to serve as a route for attack.</p>

<p>Operating systems and middleware provide a conducive environment
for application programs to interact in a controlled manner, much as
Petra must have served for spice merchants 2000 years ago.  Access to
communication and resources remain as important as then, but so does
the provision of tightly controlled interfaces that ensure
security.</p>
